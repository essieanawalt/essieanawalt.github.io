## Today, I Quit

I've frequently heard that *you should never quit your job until your next one is lined up*. What if your ideal career move requires additional skills, but you do not have the time? What if your dream position or company is waiting for you, but you find yourself without the mental energy at the end of the day?

This is where I found myself. For weeks, I debated... and I *really* tried to make it work.

Today, I closed my eyes and leaped.

* 2 weeks until I'm fully resigned
* 6 weeks until check-in

## The Day After

First thing's first: I recognize that I am at a lucky and privileged point in my life where I can quit my job and be financially okay for a little bit (thank you, compulsive saving + living situation).

Outside of work, Today I: 
* Started [iamtimcorey.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ptWR16ITQyYOglXyQmpzw): C# fundamentals and MVC concepts
* Began week #2 of [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) bootcamp: a 30-week program for full-stack web development

I want to focus on VS Code as my primary code editor since I am on Mac, so I spent some time going through [Intro to VSCode for C# Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5dtl9Uq9V0) by Tim Corey. Additionally, Microsoft Docs has an [MVC Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio) which can be toggled to use VS Code as well as general documentation on [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/).

I'm making sure to take long walks with audiobooks (I'm a big fan of Agatha Christie), breaks for piano (another new skill I'm learning), and video games and/or movies. 

Overall, I feel calmer. I have a tangible goal *and* I will soon have the time to make greater progress towards it.

## I Only Wish I Leaped Sooner

First thing's first: I know I am in a lucky and privilidged point in my life where I have the ability to quit my job and be financially okay for a little bit (thank you, compulsive saving + living situation).

Outside of work, I am working on two separate paths:
* Started iamtimcorey.com: C# fundamentals and MVC concepts
* Week #2 of 100devs bootcamp: a 30 week program for fullstack web development

I want to focus in on VS Code as my primary IDE since I am on Mac, so I spent some time going through [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5dtl9Uq9V0) by Tim Corey. Microsoft Docs has an [MVC Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio) which can be toggled to use VS Code as well as general documentation on [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/).

I'm making sure to take long walks when I can with audiobooks (I'm a big fan of Agatha Christie), breaks for piano (another new skill I'm learning), and video games and/or movies. 

Overall, I feel calmer. I have a tangible goal *and* I will soon have the time to make greater progress towards it.

* 8 more workdays until I'm fully resigned
* 6 weeks until check-in

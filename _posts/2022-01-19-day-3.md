## Working in VS Code

One thing that's difficult with C# tutorials is how most everything is written for Windows + Visual Studios. However, learning how to use the CLI for new projects, nuget packages, and even scaffolding means I'm gaining added insight into what is going on behind the scenes.

Here are some of the articles I've been working from:
* How to run Debug in VS Code when User/Terminal Input is required: [update launch.json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/debugging-with-visual-studio-code?pivots=dotnet-6-0)
* How to launch a console app: [CLI: dotnet new console --framework net5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code?pivots=dotnet-6-0)
* How to launch an MVC project in VS Code: [CLI: dotnet new sln + dotnet new mvc -n mvc-web-app](https://www.collaborationnotcompetition.com/developing-mvc-application-with-vscode/)
    * For the initial start, I prefer: [dotnet new mvc -o NAME](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio-code)

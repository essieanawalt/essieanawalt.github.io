## Pomodoro + Anki

Learning doesn't just happen. No matter how long I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, aliens are not going to abduct me and transplant the knowledge directly into my mind (although I can still daydream about it).

In the first class of [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/), Leon assigned a couple of learning-focused videos and courses. I hope no one minds that I share them here, too:
* [How to Study for Exams - Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE)
* [How to Study for Exams - Spaced Repetition - Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM)
* [Learning how to Learn - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome)

The third link is a course, and despite being listed as a 4-week course, it is doable in a week or so if you prefer. 

I took away a few items:
1. Set up your tools and environment to support you
2. Engage with the material via questions and spaced repetition
3. Focus on small pieces and the process over the end product

I am working with a few tools to help anchor my learning. For flashcards, I am using **Anki** in a question-answer format. For my second brain, I am using **Notion**, although I'm still vetting this out . For simply getting myself to sit down and focus, I'm using a basic **Pomodoro** app (any will do).

Curious about the second brain concept?

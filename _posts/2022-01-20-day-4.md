## Learning Tools

Learning doesn't just happen. No matter how long I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, aliens are not going to abduct me and transplant the knowledge directly into my mind (although I can still daydream about it). Instead, learning is an active practice.

In the first class of [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/), Leon assigned a couple of learning-focused videos and courses:
* YouTube: [How to Study for Exams by Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE)
* YouTube: [How to Study for Exams - Spaced Repetition by Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-zNHHpXoMM)
* Coursera: [Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome)

The third link is a course, and despite being listed as 4-weeks, it is doable in a week or so. 

I took away a few key items:
1. Set up your tools and environment to support you
2. Engage with the material via questions and spaced repetition
3. Focus on small pieces and the process over the end product

The first step is to set up my tools and environment to anchor my learning. For flashcards, I am using **Anki** in a question-answer format. For my second brain, I am using **Notion**, although I'm still vetting this out . For simply getting myself to sit down and focus, I'm using a basic **Pomodoro** app. There is still room for modification and improvement, and figuring out what works best for my workflow is key. 

Curious about the second brain concept?
